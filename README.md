# N-Queens Parallel Implementation Comparison

This project compares the parallel implementations of the N-Queens problem using **Pthreads** and **OpenMP**. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial challenge, and by implementing it with different parallel programming models, we aim to evaluate performance and efficiency.

## Overview

The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project implements parallel solutions for the N-Queens problem using:

1. **Pthreads** (POSIX threads)
2. **OpenMP**

We will compare these approaches based on performance, scalability, and ease of implementation.
